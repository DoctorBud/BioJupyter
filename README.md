# BioJupyter

Experiments with Jupyter and Biodata APIs.

Our goal here is to create a catalog of working examples that demonstrate how to access, transform, integrate and visualize the diverse data sources we intend to use for projects like Translator.

We are currently using Jupyter notebooks as our means of documenting, prototyping, and sharing code. As some of these experiments mature into working prototype pipelines, we intend to extract this functionality from the notebooks and migrate it into a production pipeline.

### One-time Setup

You will need Python (e.g., Python 3.5.2).

```
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install jupyter ipython pandas requests
```

### Running

```
source env/bin/activate
jupyter notebook
```
